Simulates a parking lot

You will need Python 3.6+ to run this.

### Installing Python 3

On Ubuntu, run

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

On Mac, use Hoembrew to install Python

```
brew install python
```

If you don't have Homebrew, please follow instructions in this [link](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/)

### Running the application

In the terminal, run the application by

```
python3 app.py
```

Of course, this command needs to be run in the directory containing current code.

The code will then ask you for input file address. Enter the address and hit enter.

Happy exploring!
